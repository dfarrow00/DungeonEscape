# Dungeon Escape

This project was made whilst following the GameDev.tv course [Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/). This section of the course covered lighting, C++ components, sphere sweeps, grabbing objects with physics handle and trigger boxes. 

Once the section was completed, I added some features of my own to further push my learning. These include the green object outline when the object is grabbale, sound effects, moving pillars, cell door and key mechanics and the end game trigger and UI.
